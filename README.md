# A* Search Algorithm
- Contained in the folder CppND-Route-Planning-Project.
- It was implemented an A* grid-based search algorithm.
- The searching behavior a BFS like algorithm is to visit priority of neighbor nodes w/ higher int f value, which is a dynamic value relate to its current node during the search process, that equals to the sum of int h (Heuristic) and int g value, i.e., f(n) = g(n) + h(n).
- A set of tests is provided by Udacity, that have been passed using this implementation.
