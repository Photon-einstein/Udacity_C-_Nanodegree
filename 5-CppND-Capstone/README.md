## Description of the Project

This project consists of an simulator of an elevator system.<br />
Users are able to add elevators to the system, as well as seen the status of a<br />
given elevator.<br />
Users also are able to call an elevator to a certain floor.<br />
The floors and floor names were kept hard coded in the main.cpp file.<br />
<br />
* Here is an example of the input/output commands that the user can type to the<br />
terminal:<br />
add_elevator <elevator-id> <max-weight-supported-in-kgs><br />
status <elevator-id><br />
call_elevator <elevator-id> <floor id><br />
enter_elevator <elevator-id> <total-weight-in-kgs-entering> <floor id called><br />
exit_elevator <elevator-id> <weight-exiting><br />
continue <elevator-id><br />
<br />
* Example of the command add_elevator <elevator-id> <max-weight-supported-in-kgs><br />
Example command: add_elevator 1 200<br />
This commands adds elevator id = 1, that supports a maximum of 200 kgs in it.<br />
The elevators starts at the beginning in the lowest floor id.<br />

  Response:<br />
  success -> if the request is successful<br />
  failure -> if the request fails<br />

* Example of the command status <elevator_id><br />
Example Command: status 2<br />
This requests for real time status of the elevator 2.<br />
<br />
  Possible responses are:<br />
  Status of Elevator id=2: movingUp, at floor = xxx, going to floor = xxx, curr.: xxx kg / max.: xxx kg.<br />
  Status of Elevator id=2: movingDown, at floor = xxx, going to floor = xxx, curr.: xxx kg / max.: xxx kg.<br />
  Status of Elevator id=2: stationary, at floor = xxx, going to floor = xxx, curr.: xxx kg / max.: xxx kg.<br />
<br />
  it is also printed the content of the elevator in terms of call_elevator and<br />
  enter_elevator commands, example of the content provided also with the status 2:<br />
    Content of enter to elevator 2: Enter_elevator 2 400 3<br />
    Content of enter to elevator 2: Enter_elevator 2 400 2<br />
    Content of calls to elevator 2: Call_elevator 2 5<br />
<br />
* Example of the command call_elevator <elevator-id> <floor id><br />
Example Command: call_elevator 2 5<br />
This request call the elevator with the id=5 to the floor number 5.<br />
<br />
  Possible responses are:<br />
  success -> if the request is successful<br />
  failure -> if the request fails<br />
<br />
* Example of the command continue <elevator-id><br />
Example: continue 1<br />
This request for the next action in elevator 1. If the elevator has is moving<br />
then it will stop in the next call_elevator or enter_elevator action. If the<br />
elevator is stationary and has some enter_elevator or call_elevator in storage<br />
then it will pass to a moving state when continue is used.<br />
(if the elevator is stationary and has no call_elevator in the system, if it<br />
receives the first call_elevator it will automatically switch to a moving state,<br />
in all the other cases it needs the continue commmand).<br />
<br />
* Example of the command enter_elevator <elevator-id> <total-weight-in-kgs-entering> <floor id called><br />
Example: enter_elevator 2 80 3<br />
This request for the elevator id=2 to a person with 80 kg to enter in the<br />
elevator, to go to the floor id=3. If the elevator donÂ´t admit this weight then<br />
it will fail the command. This command can only be used when the elevator is at<br />
a stationary state.<br />
<br />
  Possible responses are:<br />
  success -> if the request is successful<br />
  failure -> if the request fails<br />
<br />
* Example of the command exit_elevator <elevator-id> <total-weight-in-kgs-exiting><br />
Example_ exit_elevator 2 90<br />
This request for a person to leave elevator 2, weighting 90 kg, it can only<br />
leave the elevator if the elevator is stationary.<br />
<br />
  Possible responses are:<br />
  success -> if the request is successful<br />
  failure -> if the request fails<br />
<br />
* The command "out" is used to exit the program.<br />
<br />
## File and class structure of the program<br />
<br />
* In the main.cpp it is initialized the output file "output.txt" that is going to<br />
have all the commands inserted in the system with the replies as well as the<br />
floors data. In this file there is a cycle that receives the input from the user<br />
and then it uses a switch case to decide witch action to take.<br />
<br />
* In the class Floor (Floor.h/cpp) are stored the floor number and floor type,<br />
with the getters and setters.<br />
<br />
* In the namespace CapstoneParser (CapstoneParser.h/cpp) are several utility<br />
functions used in the main to print data to file and cout, to print commands<br />
info in each cycle, to receive and parse the commands, to add the floor data to<br />
the class scheduler as well as other data validations.<br />
<br />
* In the class Scheduler (Scheduler.h/cpp) there are several methods that implement<br />
all the commands. There is in this class the vector of elevators and floors<br />
present in the system and also mapping between then and the id of each one. The<br />
Scheduler decides witch call_elevator or enter_elevator to serve using the<br />
principle of FIFO (First In First Out) algorithm.<br />
<br />
*The the class Elevator (Elevator.h/cpp) has several methods that implement<br />
the several commands at the elevator level, it is present all the data needed<br />
for that effect namely the id, max and current weight, actual floor number, the<br />
state of the elevator and the list of all the call_elevator and/or enter_elevator<br />
to serve.<br />

* The program prints all the commands received as well as all the actions and<br />
responses taken to the file "output.txt" at the build directory.<br />
<br />
## Example of a output of the program, that was generated in the file "output.txt" <br />
<br />
File "output.txt" opened sucessfully. <br />

## Rubric specifications addressing<br />
<br />
# Criteria 1: The project demonstrates an understanding of C++ functions and<br />
control structures.<br />
<br />
There are used control structures as whiles in the main.cpp (line 45), as well<br />
as switch cases in main.cpp (line 53) or for loops in CapstoneParser.cpp (line
  156).<br />
<br />
The code is divided in functions as we can observe in the CapstoneParser.h.<br />
<br />
# Criteria 2: The project reads data from a file and process the data, or the<br />
program writes data to a file.<br />
<br />
The code writes data to file "output.txt" in the build directory, for example in <br />
Scheduler.cpp (line 35).<br />
<br />
# Criteria 3: The project accepts user input and processes the input. <br />
<br />
It receives user input in CapstoneParser.cpp (line 149) and processes the input <br />
int CapstoneParser.cpp (method CapstoneParser::commandParser line 91). <br />
<br />
# Criteria 4: The project uses Object Oriented Programming techniques.<br />
<br />
This project uses OOP, with the Scheduler, Elevator and Floor classes.<br />
Each class has data and methods that work on that data, example in Scheduler.cpp<br />
(line 24).<br />
<br />
# Criteria 5: Classes use appropriate access specifiers for class members.<br />
<br />
All data members use private specifiers in Elevator.h (line 66), Floor.h<br />
(line 23) or public in Scheduler.h (line 41)<br />
<br />
# Criteria 6: Class constructors utilize member initialization lists.<br />
<br />
At Floor.cpp (line 8), Scheduler.cpp (line 14) and Elevator.cpp (line 10 and 17)<br />
<br />
# Criteria 7: The project makes use of references in function declarations.<br />
<br />
At Scheduler.h (lines 20 and 23).<br />
<br />
# Criteria 8: The project uses destructors appropriately.<br />
<br />	
At Scheduler.h (line 16).<br />
<br />
# Criteria 9: The project uses smart pointers instead of raw pointers.<br />
<br />
The project uses shared_pt instead of raw pointers in all the project,<br />
for example in Scheduler.h (line 41).<br />
